The following are key characteristics of CERG:

    # Choice of students: the idea of the group communicated among students, and only those who really want to learn new things had voluntarily decided to be part of the group, no student were asked to be part of the group. In other words, only those who were willing to put efforts to learn were chosen.
    # Levels of students: Initially, we have students from all levels (including one L6 student).
    Objectives of CERG:

1- Knowledge transfer: Starting form myself, I will create weekly / monthly workshops to transfer knowledge to the group members in basic and advanced topics. After that, similar workshops will be done to transfer knowledge on the form of student-to-student.

2- Teams of specialty: After examining the skills of the group members, 3 main subgroups will be created: Cybersecurity, AI, and Data Mining. No student will choose which subgroup he will be joining, the process will be done through challenges, and those who prove their skills in a certain area will be added to the subgroup.

3- Publishing: Upon improving the student skills in academic writing as well as development, students will be encouraged to publish their work in conferences and journals.

4- Development: Considering the resources we have at MTC, students will be encouraged to develop prototypes and systems, such as Arduino systems, networks, etcâ€¦
