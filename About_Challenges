Code credits go to HTB

* Important notes:

1-	If you haven’t solved any of the challenges, it does not mean you are not a member of CERG, it means you learned something new! 

2-	Please do not search for ready solutions (if there is any) on Google. These challenges are for learning, no assessment is involved! 

3- Send your submissions to maamoun.khalid (at) mtc.edu.om or dr.maamoun (at) outlook.com 

4-	Hints: challenge#1 (AI’s prediction), challenge#2 (Twitter Scrapping and NLP ), challenge#3 (study the algorithm, line by line).
